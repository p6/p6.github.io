We analyze the individual in subject - mostly of Kannada brahmaNa heritage with ancestral roots clustering around Hassan-Chikkamagalur belt skirting the western ghats.

* 3/4 subject's grandparents are Babbur Kamme smartas. An ethnic subgroup fairly preponderant in the region.
* The subject's parents are known to be related (the subject's maternal grandmother is his father's first cousin via his mother's line)
* Lineages on the Kamme line are speculatively well understood in time and space, despite the lack of formal records

Now - 1/4 grandparents is the subject's paternal grandfather is S| Krishna Rao (~1910 - 1962) - married to Smt| Nagaratna (~1920 - 1958). Since he passed away early leaving behind 4 children, including a 4 year old - very little was known about his origins even to his own children. Puzzlingly enough - the oldest of his children were actually in their teens, but did not breach the topic into any detail, owing partly to apathy, circumstances as also his aggressive temperament (despite being a loving father).

All that is existent 56 years hence his demise are a bunch of facts & anecdotes:

<!--more-->

* Lived a good part of his life in Arasikere - a junction railway town with a reputation for coconut trading; Probably moved there from Tiptur, another important trading town in the same district, closer to Tumkur. This was ~1935
* His ancestors hailed from below the ghats - in Mangalore
* He belonged to a family of hotel entrepreneurs 
* Krishna Rao himself was a Coconut Merchant and a partner in a manDi, along with an Arya-vaisya seTTi. Formerly, this was one Chintapalli Bhaskara Setty and subsequent to his move into Arasikere, one Ramayya Setty
* He was the only/last of kin and his parents (Father - S| Venkanna) had passed away early. No immediate relatives were known even to his family
* A man of some taste and reputation: Wrote and spoke English quite well (Amongst other languages, including Kannada, English, Telugu and Tulu)
* Even had political convictions - non-congress even then: Was a one time councillor in the Arasikere municipality from PSP: Praja Socialist Party!
* A man of some philanthropy - was known to give (sometimes in an unreasonably generous manner) - he sheltered and provided for a whole group of his sons' maternal cousins since Arasikere had among the better educational facilities in the district at that time. Amongst these beneficiaries was also the eminent Haranahalli Ramaswamy
* Smoked branded cigarettes (only)!
* Resembled Kamaraj Nadar!

However - the summary of the above anecdotes fall short of being able to trace anything more about his origins, excepting speculation. That's all we know.

This raises some fundamental questions: How even did Krishna Rao wed Smt| Nagaratna (a Kamme) in an age (C 1930s) where it was very rare to marry outside of one's subgroup? We could speculate Krishna Rao could have belonged to one of the acceptable subgroups - such as Badaganadu, Hoysala Karnataka or others - but this is unlikely with the known detail about origins in Mangalore - which none of these groups are native to. Even if we were to accept this, it would make it difficult to explain the complete lack of extended relatives in a region that all of these subgroups have significant populations in.

Inter-subgroup marriages between Kammes and others were not unheard of though probably much less acceptable. We can say that it was largely OK with other Kannada smArta subgroups native to the Mysore region (as speculated above) but still very unlikely with other ethno-theological groups (such as mAdhwas or SrivaiShnavas) or alien subgroups (such as sankEtis);

We must speculate that perhaps the subject's great-grandfather and father in law of Krishna Rao  - S| Nanjappa (of Belur) chose quick wins over tribal purity given that he had all of 6 daughters to marry off. Notably, almost all of the son in laws were previously married and were second-time grooms (except Krishna Rao); Less notably, atleast one was a _sahavAsi_ - belonging to an alien group of brahmaNas, who may have been of Kashmiri stock migrated to Karnataka earlier in the 13th century. Marrying out of the somewhat inbred Kamme group being rare, wasn't that unprecedented .. we guess.

The subject's own father opined that Krishna Rao was probably a Havyaka; His older cousin - who had grown up in Arasikere for many years and closely observed Krishna Rao reckoned he was a Shivalli or Kota, since he also had knowledge of or spoke Tulu at times - with another hotelier called Appanna in Arasikere. 

Curiously - Krishna Rao himself added further heterogeneity into this genepool by marrying his daughter (the subject's aunt) to a Telugu speaking Aruvela Niyogi family from Mysore - the only marriage of his children that he oversaw before he passed away. You could half wonder if he was part of this stock himself?

Even when he passed away - no close kin of his were known to have visited, leading to a puzzling question. Whilst he may not have had immediate siblings, what explains his remarkable isolation? Did he not know OR chose not to disclose OR was he just separated from his extended family owing to some circumstance?

Fast forward to 2017 - we ended up discovering some details from an accidental DNA test on 23andme.
