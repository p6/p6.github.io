Work + Startups
===============
+ <a href="https://platformatory.io">Platformatory</a>: Consulting collective focusing on modernization, platform architecture & large scale distributed systems engineering. We mostly solve problems intersecting infrastructure, data & applications; We also run tech focused practices centred aroud Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Kong, Envoy and Kubernetes.
  
+ <a href="http://srijan.net">Srijan</a>: Medium sized digital boutique servicing everything Digital experience (particularly Enterprise Content Management Systems, but also API Management amongst other things); Apart from tech, I also tried a hand at management, sales (which is an NP-hard problem), marketing and while at it, gained the unique distinction of creating sales decks with LaTeX. I've since learned a thing or two about what it takes to build services organizations that can (or not) be creative, thoughtful partners in engineering.

+ <a href="http://muktilifestyle.com">Mukti</a> - an incubator with a portfolio of homegrown & invested digital businesses, some of which could count as good exits. Mukti specialized in building ecosystem businesses. My title was CTO/CPO, but in reality, I ended up as a resident handyman and wrote more code than was necessary (in retrospect); 

+ Content Media = {<a href="http://radioweb.in/programs">Radioweb Carnatic</a>, <a href="http://bhakti.radioweb.in">Radioweb Bhakti</a>, <a href="http://hindustani.radioweb.in">Radioweb Bhakti</a>}. Wrote the original streaming platform from scratch in what was pre-cloud era: Lots of media processing, transcoding for the web and content distribution; Once upon a time, Radioweb attempted to compete with MIO, Gaana & Spotify. Ever since, we have reconciled to run as a lightweight online radio that caters to an ageing, but loyal audience of traditional music aficionados.

+ Less noteworthy / distant past: 
  + a medium-scale PaaS for node.js (acquired in 2015)
  + yet another web/mobile dev shop (bootstrapped, twice to revenues, 20+ headcount) 
  + a CRM product loosely based on SugarCRM (not dead yet)
  + an adventure tourism company that did ecommerce before it was cool (also alive), 
  + freelance tech consulting (wrote device drivers, web software, administered servers, what nots)

Tech / OSS
==========

+ Past work (2005 - 2012): Mostly web applications (on PHP / Python / SQL / NoSQL stacks), mobile - (Android, Cordova) & even _a bit_ of systems programming.

+ Recent (2012 - 2016): node.js / v8 runtime - "at the intersection of C++ & JavaScript" (sic). JavaScript has been a reluctant love story.

+ ArchLinux, Vim, Drupal & Node.js. I've <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/p6">contributed / maintained code</a> on several projects.

+ General and Special Interests: Domain Driven Design & Microservices, Distributed Systems (Kubernetes, Apache Kafka), Functional Programming (mostly Lua these days)

Other Esoteric Interests
=========

+ Astronomy: Observing, Photography, DIY;  *Founder but lapsed member of <a href="http://bas.org.in">The Bangalore Astronomical Society</a>*

+ India: Classical literature (Sanskrit, Kannada), History, Epigraphy, Linguistics, Population Genomics.

+ Travel: Himalayas, Western Ghats

+ Music: Karnatak Classical, Hindustani, Hindi/Kannada film music of the yore. *Can dabble with instruments: VÄ«na (badly, despite formal training), Flute (worse, but no formal training), Violin (hazardous autodidactism), Bathroom and other singing (mass destruction capabilities);*

+ Misc: Propensity for spicy vegetarian food ("Andhra grade"), beverages (Mostly non-alcoholic), random walking, BMTC buses and cute furry animals.
