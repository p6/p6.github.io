Summary
=======

p6: (p) - {Developer, Backpacker, Dilettante}

grahaNa (n: seize/consume, meta: eclipse) - is a weblog of musings - 
usually on - Code, Technology, India, History, Culture, Arts.

Work & Startups
==============

Presently: Mukti Lifestyle - a new age technology incubator with
a portfolio of propreitary & funded digital businesses.

Previously: a PaaS, web/mobile dev shop startup (twice), a product for CRM,
adventure tourism, freelance / consulting.

Other: Content Media (Radioweb Carnatic & Bhakti);

Tech / OSS:
===========

My past work has been mostly web applications (on PHP / Python / 
SQL / NoSQL stacks), mobile - (Android, Cordova) & even a bit systems 
programming.

In recent times - my focus has been mostly node.js / v8 - "at the
intersection of C++ & JavaScript" (sic). JavaScript has been a 
reluctant love story.

I have mentionable inclination towards open-source software: particularly -
ArchLinux, Vim, Drupal & Node.js. I've <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/p6">contributed / maintained code</a> on a 
bunch of projects (much less than I'd like to, though).

I have amateur interest in TCS, Math & Functional Programming.

Travel
======

Travel is my true soul-calling. My life's most memorable and unique
experiences so far have been in the Himalayas; I've trekked in Garhwal 
(extensively), Kumaon (less) & Eastern Himalaya (few);

Equally enriching experiences have comein the western ghats of Karnataka (exhaustively),
Kerala (less) & Maharashtra (some);

Astronomy
=========

Long term interest in gazing stars, borne out of laziness, love for physics 
& darkness (sic);

My efforts towards DIY telescope-making have failed so far (although I've 
ground 3 mirrors, polished  wo others & kept them around); I tendentiously
like large aperture telescopes for visual astronomy.

In 2006, organizing amateur astronomy meetups gave rise to The Bangalore 
Astronomical Society - now a registered NPO with a prolific history of 
promoting Astronomy in India. I've served since as founder-secretary, Web Admin &
Event Coordinator (among other things); 

Despite being inactive the last few years, association with BAS continues 
to be a rewarding experience (and has earned me a treasurable social circle);

Photography
===========

A lost passion that springs to life once in a a while - especially on my travels.
My tastes are for celestial, landscapes & photo documentaries.

Music
=====

I enjoy listening to Karnatak Classical Music (mostly), Hindusthani (less), Light Music /
Bhavagite (as much), Kannada / Hindi Film Music (up till the 80s) - and some rock music.

I can dabble with a few instruments: Veena (badly, despite formal training), Flute (worse), 
Violin (Hazardous); My neighbours have complained about all these & my bathroom singing.
