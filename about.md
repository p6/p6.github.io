grahaNa (n: seize/consume, meta: eclipse) - is a weblog of musings - usually on - Technology, OSS, India, History, Culture, Arts & ಠ_ಠ.

Work + Startups
===============

+ <a href="http://muktilifestyle.com">Mukti Lifestyle</a> - an incubator with a portfolio of proprietary & funded digital businesses.

+ Content Media = {<a href="http://radioweb.in/programs">Radioweb Carnatic</a>, <a href="http://bhakti.radioweb.in">Radioweb Bhakti</a>}.

+ Previously: a PaaS, web/mobile dev shop startup (twice), a product for CRM, adventure tourism, freelance / consulting.

Tech / OSS
==========

+ Past work: Mostly web applications (on PHP / Python / SQL / NoSQL stacks), mobile - (Android, Cordova) & even _a bit_ of systems programming.

+ Recent times: Mostly node.js / v8 - "at the intersection of C++ & JavaScript" (sic). JavaScript has been a reluctant love story.

+ Mentionable inclination towards open-source software: particularly - ArchLinux, Vim, Drupal & Node.js. I've <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/p6">contributed / maintained code</a> on a bunch of projects (much less than I'd like to, though).

+ Hobby interest in TCS, Math & Functional Programming.

Travel
======

+ A true soul-calling. My life's most memorable and unique experiences so far have been in the Himalayas; I've trekked in Garhwal (extensively), Kumaon (less) & Eastern Himalaya (few);

+ Equally enriching experiences in the western ghats of Karnataka (exhaustively), Kerala (less) & Maharashtra (some);


Astronomy
=========

+ Lasting interest in gazing stars, borne out of laziness, love for physics & darkness (sic);

+ Efforts towards DIY telescope-making have failed so far (Despite grinding 3 mirrors & polishing two others); Impulse enthusiasm towards visual observing (catalysed by Bortle II or better skies & the availability of large aperture scopes);

+ In 2006, organizing amateur astronomy meetups gave rise to <a href="http://bas.org.in">The Bangalore Astronomical Society</a> - now a registered NPO with a prolific history of promoting Astronomy in India. I've served since as - founder-secretary, Web Admin & Event Coordinator (among other things); Despite being inactive the last few years, association with BAS continues to be a rewarding experience (and has earned me a treasurable social circle);

Photography
===========

+ A lost passion that springs to life once in a a while - especially whilst traveling.

+ Tastes = {Celestial, Landscapes, Photo documentaries}.

+ Canon Loyalist.

Music
=====

+ Karnatak Classical Music (mostly), Hindusthani (less), Light Music / Bhavagite (as much), Kannada / Hindi Film Music (up till the 80s) - and _some_ rock music.

+ Can dabble with a few instruments: Vīna (badly, despite formal training), Flute (worse), Violin (Hazardous); My neighbours have complained about all these & my bathroom singing.

Reading
=======
+ Kannada: SL Bhairappa, Kuvempu, Tejaswi, Karanth.

+ English: Shakespeare, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Hemmingway, Dickens, Dumas, Mark Twain.

+ Philosophy: Kant, Nietzshe, Spinoza, Russell, Vivekananda, Ramakrshna, Adi Sankara.
