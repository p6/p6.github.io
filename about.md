Work + Startups
===============

+ <a href="http://srijan.net">Srijan</a> a global full stack digital engineering company; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Speculatively</a> in a role responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">business growth</a>, which happens to be an NP-Hard problem. 

+ <a href="http://muktilifestyle.com">Mukti</a> - an incubator with a portfolio of proprietary & funded digital businesses. Here, I was a CTO, CPO and handyman all at once. 

+ Content Media = {<a href="http://radioweb.in/programs">Radioweb Carnatic</a>, <a href="http://bhakti.radioweb.in">Radioweb Bhakti</a>, <a href="http://hindustani.radioweb.in">Radioweb Bhakti</a>}. Mostly the guy who wrote everything from scratch exactly once, or a CTO that never was; Once upon a time, we attempted to compete with MIO, Gaana & Spotify. Ever since, we have reconciled to run as a lightweight online radio that caters to a loyal audience of traditional music aficionados.

+ Previously: a medium-scale PaaS, web/mobile dev shop (twice), a CRM product, adventure tourism, freelance / consulting.

+ May have _some_ time for pro-bono (if necessary) work around interesting ideas, philanthropic & local/civic causes.

Tech / OSS
==========

+ Past work: Mostly web applications (on PHP / Python / SQL / NoSQL stacks), mobile - (Android, Cordova) & even _a bit_ of systems programming.

+ Recent / present: node.js / v8 - "at the intersection of C++ & JavaScript" (sic). JavaScript has been a reluctant love story.

+ ArchLinux, Vim, Drupal & Node.js. I've <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/p6">contributed / maintained code</a> on several projects.

+ Interests: Distributed Systems (Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Golang), Functional Programming (mostly JS, Some Lisp, Some Haskell)

+ India: Classical literature (Sanskrit, Kannada), History, Epigraphy, Linguistics.

+ Travel: Himalayas, Western Ghats, Heritage.

+ Music: Karnatak Classical, Hindustani, Hindi/Kannada film music of the yore. *Can dabble with instruments: VÄ«na (badly, despite formal training), Flute (worse, but no formal training), Violin (hazardous autodidactism), Bathroom and other singing (mass destruction capabilities);*
