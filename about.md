Work + Startups
===============

+ <a href="http://srijan.net">Srijan</a> a 400 strong, global, digital engineering company; I learned to manage, then un-manage, and finally ended up on the dark side. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Somewhat accidentally,</a> I'm presently in a role responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">growth</a>, which happens to be an NP-Hard problem. Over the last 3.5 years, I have learned to use spreadsheets better than I could previously, although I still dwell into using LaTeX to create sales decks.

+ <a href="http://muktilifestyle.com">Mukti</a> - an incubator with a portfolio of homegrown & invested digital businesses. While I joined a CPO with a product management charter, I ended up getting my hands dirty doing practically everything. 

+ Content Media = {<a href="http://radioweb.in/programs">Radioweb Carnatic</a>, <a href="http://bhakti.radioweb.in">Radioweb Bhakti</a>, <a href="http://hindustani.radioweb.in">Radioweb Bhakti</a>}. Mostly the guy who wrote everything from scratch, because it was fun to solve for a media manipulation & streaming problem in the early era of the cloud; Once upon a time, Radioweb attempted to compete with MIO, Gaana & Spotify. Ever since, we have reconciled to run as a lightweight online radio that caters to an agein but loyal audience of traditional music aficionados.

+ Previously: a medium-scale PaaS (acquired in 2015), web/mobile dev shop (bootstrapepd X 2), a CRM product (open-source, undead), adventure tourism (still going strong, without me), freelance tech consulting (caused limited harm to customers while at it)

+ May have _some_ time for pro-bono (if necessary) work around interesting ideas, philanthropic & local/civic causes. 

Tech / OSS
==========

+ Past work (2005 - 2012): Mostly web applications (on PHP / Python / SQL / NoSQL stacks), mobile - (Android, Cordova) & even _a bit_ of systems programming.

+ Recent (2012 - 2016): node.js / v8 runtime - "at the intersection of C++ & JavaScript" (sic). JavaScript has been a reluctant love story.

+ ArchLinux, Vim, Drupal & Node.js. I've <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/p6">contributed / maintained code</a> on several projects.

+ Interests: Distributed Systems (Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Golang), Functional Programming (mostly JS, some Haskell)

Other Esoteric Interests
=========

+ Astronomy: Observing, Photography, DIY;  *Founder but lapsed member of <a href="http://bas.org.in">The Bangalore Astronomical Society</a>*

+ India: Classical literature (Sanskrit, Kannada), History, Epigraphy, Linguistics.

+ Travel: Himalayas, Western Ghats, Indic heritage.

+ Music: Karnatak Classical, Hindustani, Hindi/Kannada film music of the yore. *Can dabble with instruments: VÄ«na (badly, despite formal training), Flute (worse, but no formal training), Violin (hazardous autodidactism), Bathroom and other singing (mass destruction capabilities);*

+ Misc: Propensity for spicy vegetarian food ("Andhra grade"), beverages (Mostly non-alcoholic), random walking, BMTC buses and cute furry animals.
