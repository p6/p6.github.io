Fast forward to 2016 - a 23andme DNA test (for somewhat related reasons) enabled the discovery of a whole cohort of distant cousins most likely part of the 3/4 Kamme pool, with origins in Karnataka malenad or vicinity. 

Whilst the size of this pool (~120) was quite surprising, as also the fact that they're almost all immigrants into the US, note that we do not readily know the precise nature of relationship in most cases. The magnitude of autosomal match roughly puts a common ancestor within the range of 3-5 generations.

From all this, it certainly appears 23andme is the most comprehensive data pool for south asian genomics, since the same test repeated for the subject's sibling, uncle and another relative on FtDNA received no matches at all (apart from themselves). 

There was also another discrete emergence - a credible 1% IBD autosomal match, with no relationship to this known pool, but instead to another smaller cluster - all of whom appeared to have coastal origins (previously we interpreted these as a noise - identical by chance); Some days later - a second match emerged, lending it even more interest. We'll speak more about them later.

We can make the following observations:

* Uniparental MtDNA Haplogroup: **M3a2**; This preponderates in West and Northwestern India. TMRCA ~5.7K YBP to 15K YBP.
* Uniparental Y-DNA Haplogroup **H M-69**: roughly dates to a ~40K YBP emergence - most likely in India since it is almost absent elsewhere (H2-P96 being a notable exception - found in Sardinia and possibly some ancient DNA in Iberia) except in migratory or domiciled populations of Indian origin (Romani, notably); It is the primary Indian tribal marker, likely representative of an original Indian Hunter-Gather group.  The locus of maximum diversity is Andhra Pradesh which invariably associates a relationship with the Dravidian group of languages.
* For various reasons, we believe the deeper clade of H of the subjects must be H-P80 or H-APT (H1a2a); 
     * This is much rarer than the popular brother clades H-M52, H-M82.
     * The phylogenetic tree for H is in a little bit of a flux. H-P80 and P-266 are supposed to be downstream clades of H-APT, but we know of cases where those tested positive for these markers didn't test positive for APT.
     * We're not sure about the age of this clade or it's distribution - but Sengupta et al report a finding amongst several groups at [low frequencies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1380230/table/TB6/?report=objectonly), whilst another study by Underhill, Firasat et al report some distribution amongst Gujarati groups as well as [1/77 in a sample of Greeks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2588664/table/T1/?report=objectonly). 

Based on this, we run self service Admix runs:

Given the subjects and their ancestry, we can say the following things:

* Subjects are Y-DNA Haplogroup H. This is by no means absent, but somewhat inclines down as we go up the caste ladder particularly amongst the brahmins. Studies put the frequency of H amongst Brahmins broadly in the range of 15 - 30%.
* Given the association of invading or migrating Indo Aryans as almost wholly R1a1-Z93, we can only explain the absorption of carriers of Y-DNA H into the brahmin varna in particular, as upward social mobility of (possibly elite) tribal lineages into the IA fold. This explanation also holds for J/L haplogroups that are more dominant in the middle-castes but represented amongst brahmin y-DNA lineages.
* The subjects in question are of roughly the same composition as other modelled south indian brahmin groups, affirming their relative homogeneity of ancestry in contrast with other caste groups. In other words, significantly different from other regional non brahmin caste groups but similar to brahmin groups across other south india. 
* Notably however - the subjects are shifted northward vis a vis other Karnataka, Tamil or Andhra Brahmin groups - a somewhat surprising emergence.

As a fun activity, we also run RoH - runs of Homozygosity.  Here's what turns up on Chr 1, for S1:
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/yDsCdan.png)
and Chr 4:
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/NQU42bM.png)

That totals to ~49 cM, indicating parents sharing MRCA ~4 generations ago.

The same exercise, repeated for sibling S2 reveals additional shared segments.

Now, that totals upto ~105 cM - putting an MRCA in the range of 3 generations. In reality - the parents of the subjects actually share a RCA in 2.5 generations (mother happens to be the father's first cousin once removed, via their maternal lines);
