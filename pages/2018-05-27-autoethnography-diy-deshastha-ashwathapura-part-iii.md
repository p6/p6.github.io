In the previous post, we mentioned about an isolated pool of matches - not related to the core group of Babbur Kamme, the subject's known 3/4 ethnic subgroup. Instead, this appeared by all counts - part of the paternal grandfather puzzling origins.

Further so - the two new cousins found also matched on the Y-DNA haplogroup and by themselves shared autosomally as much as ~300cM.

At this point, we must mention that Indians on 23andme don't usually respond - we don't know what neuroses and complexes cause this, but presumably some may fear it could exhume property disputes of the past or something questionable to that effect. Fortunately in the subject's case, one of the two aforementioned finds responded first and the other later on - leading to a series of offline meetings that brought forth some interesting discoveries.

Brief History (by oral tradition):

- They belong to the [uttara] dEshastha sect of smArta brahmaNas.
- Their self claimed provenance lies in the vicinity of Ahmadnagar, Maharashtra.
- Their displacement out of Maharashtra was the result of Malik Kafur's invasion in the 13th century, causing them to migrate southward.
- Of these, a small set of families -- all rgvEdis of four gotras: Atreya, Srivatsa, Bharadwaja & Kashyapa migrated into lower Karnataka - Chikkamagalur and Shivamogga districts (specifically, Horanadu / Kalasa region);
- Of these, 8 families migrated down the ghats into the region around the Moodbidri area - in particular, Mijar village, and received a grant by Channaraya Chowta II.

Culture:

- Speak Kannada at home - Unmistakably Mangalore dialect.
- Most are bilingual in Tulu.
- By some claims, retained atleast some usage of Marathi until the early part of 20th century: Particularly words such as _aai_, _vahini_ etc.
- Still retain some Maharashtrian cuisine, but significantly influenced by coastal style.
- Have appropriated most Tulunad customs - such as bhuta kola, which they are impartial to. But still have tradition gondhol or _gondala_ which they are indeed partial to - something also shared with Kunbis of the Moodbidri, who appear to have been their camp followers or co-migrants. 
- Most have traditionally had `bhaTTa` suffixed to their name. In the last century, some have dropped this in favour of the somewhat more fashionable `rao`.
- Have chief deities of their clans in oral memory, although the location is no longer mappable. For instance, one Atreya clan identifies theirs as _Kamakshi-Mahalakshmi_. There are others for example with _Badami Banashankari_ as their chief deity.
- Each clan (or sub-clan) usually has an ancestral _devara mane_- house of worship in their village for housing artefacts such as idols & _saligrama_: Here they usually celebrate festivals together (in contrast with families performing vratas individually);
- Are closely knit socially in recent times. Almost all members are part of an association named as _Deshastha Brahmana Parishad, Ashwathapura_.
- They patronize the Aswathapura Seetarama temple, apparently setup at the behest and with the blessing of Sri Brahamachaitanya Maharaj, in recent times also graced by the Sringeri jagadugurus. 

Trade:

- Up till the 20th century, most were engaged prosperously in cultivating plantations, similar to _Havyakas_, _Karhades_ and other groups. 
- In the first half of 20th century, many migrated out of Tulunad into railway junctions and trading towns (Arasikere, Tiptur, Hassan, Davanagere, Hubli, Dharwad, Tumkur.. some even into Maharashtra and AP) as cooks and hotel entrepreneurs.
- A small minority are vaidikas.

Theological Allegiance

- Almost all are followers of Sringeri.
- A small minority have switched to the mAdhwa school.
- Since the turn of the 20th century, are deeply reverent followers of Sri Brahmachaitanya Maharaj of Gondavale.

Curiously, the community seems to have faced a lot of animosity with the pre-resident Shivalli brahmanas of Tulunad as well as other mAdhwas. The former - primarily owing to the dEshasthas agricultural self service - taking to the plough - an act which in Shivalli perception was irredeemable (although this is not uncommon amongst many subgroups like _havyakas_, _karhade_ (even _Sanketi_) as already mentioned)) and the latter, presumably due to the "progressive" trade of hotel entrepreneurship. In either scenario, the case makes out for their alien nature into the region and recent migration.

This escalated to the point that the dEshasthas were denied co-dining in Udupi and even had their Brahmin status disputed! After the community organized itself earlier in the 20th century, they duly filed defamation cases against their detractors and won. It appears that Sringeri maTha issued a decree validating & testifying their brahminical status and even produced some _rayasams_ from 17th century affirming their pre-eminent status.

Today, an overwhelming majority of the Aswathapura Deshasthas are settled in Bangalore, where they are strongly networked. The endonym for their ethnic collective is simply _samAja_. Marital alliances outside the _samAja_ was apparently severely frowned upon until half a century ago, although in recent times it appears that they have harmonized the pool of acceptable alliance up to other (similarly) domiciled dEshastha communities such as the tanjAvur dEshasthas. Marrying outside the samAja in present times does however, provide food for spicy conversations and self appetizing gossip sided with well relishable _patrode_.

Going by all available evidence - something we accrued further by getting the subject's paternal uncle and the new found cousin's father tested, it was eminently clear that our subjects and their new found cousins are related in the near past. In following, the 1/4 missing link clearly bridges into the Deshastha community.

In comparing all the 4 against DIY Harappa Admixture model:

|   | S1 (sibling) <br> 3/4 Kamme <br> 1/4 Deshastha| S2 (sibling)<br> 3/4 Kamme <br> 1/4 Deshastha | S3 <br> (uncle) <br> 2/4 Kamme <br> 2/4 Deshastha | S4 (cousin once? removed - ?)<br> 4/4 Deshastha |
|  :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
|  S-Indian | 46.33 | 47.1 | 46.78 | 46.25 |
|  Baloch | 35.07 | 35.66 | 35.13 | 36.37 |
|  Caucasian | 6.56 | 5.61 | 6.26 | 4.66 |
|  NE-Euro | 5.2 | 6.89 | 6.39 | 6.3 |
|  SE-Asian | 0.73 | 1.25 | 0.77 |  |
|  Siberian | 0.49 | 0.53 | 0.66 |  |
|  NE-Asian | 0.15 |  | 0.24 | 1.44 |
|  Papuan | 0.97 | 0.68 | 1.57 | 1.4 |
|  American | 0.38 | 0.07 |  |  |
|  Beringian | 1.55 | 0.78 | 0.92 | 0.71 |
|  Mediterranean | 0.65 |  | 0.61 | 1.13 |
|  SW-Asian | 1.61 | 1.43 | 0.62 | 1.65 |
|  San | 0.09 |  |  | 0.08 |
|  E-African |  |  |  |  |
|  Pygmy | 0.19 |  |  |  |
|  W-African |  |  |  |  |

As you may note, the pure bred Deshasthas have a weak signal (or perhaps noise) of NE Asian component, which is certainly missing in the Kamme admixed pool.

We also mentioned earlier that the cousins also matched on Y-DNA Haplogroup H-M69, which provokes the question of a common male ancestor.

Note that while the subjects and their claimed Gotra is _Srivatsa_, the cousins were themselves _Atreya_. However, the subjects clearly have some uncertainty about theirs, owing to the following facts:

- S\| Krishna Rao - the subject's grandfather passed away quite early.
- No known relatives.
- However - repeating pattern of names, such as _Venkanna_, _Krishna_ etc shared across the two families, but mismatching timelines. Possibly an undocumented branch or missing node.
- Subject's aunt(s) married to Telugu speaking Aruvelya Niyogi Srivatsa gotrin`s. While not incredible, we feel a deliberate sagotra marrige was unlikely, 75 years ago.
- Subject's father was largely brought up in his brother in law's (mentioned above) camp from his teenage onwards. Possibility that the family elders may have mistakenly alluded their own gotra during upanayana.
- Possible adoption at some point during the past (Atreaya boy adopted into Srivatsa house)
- Perhaps S\| Krishna Rao was forward thinking for his times - didn't really care about consanguinity by the virtue of gotra.

While preferable, it was too expensive to deduce this to a satisfiable degree with deeper Y-SNP testing, hence we attempted to triangulate the relationship with Y-STR @ 37 markers. Following result emerges:

|393|390|19|391|385a|385b|426|388|439|389i|392|389ii-i|458|459a|459b|455|454|447|437|448|449|464a|464b|464c|464d|460|GataH4|YCAIIa|YCAIIb|456|607|576|570|CDYa|CDYb|442|438|

With the below genetic distances in result:

||S1|S3 (Uncle) |S4 (Cousin?)|
|  :------: |  :------:|  :------:|  :------:|
|S1|37|1|4|
|S3 (Uncle)|1|37|3|
|S4 (Cousin?)|4|3|37|

As you will observe, the subject is at a distance of 1/37 markers (CDY is a particularly fast mutating marker) from his uncle - a known relationship with as much as 2100 cM shared autosomally. 

In contrast - the uncle is at a distance of 3/37 markets from the proposed 2nd/3rd cousin, deducing by autosomal range (~220 cM); This provides for 50% confidence of a TMRCA in 8 generations and 90% in 16 generations.

Modelling the same, with all mutation rates factored in - there is certainly a case for MRCA in the last 120-150 years, except it'd about 3 standard deviations from the expected. Below - we compute this on SAPP, based on Nordvedt's Interclade Age Estimation, which places a TMRCA ~1650 AD.

This now opens up the scenario that the subject's paternal ancestor could have branched off even farther back than the timeline of the purported migration down the ghats.

Conclusion:

A small sampling of the Deshastha pool reveals a weak signal of relationship with those who appear to be Konkanastha (such as Karhade, even GSB); There is a finite probability that this subgroup had larger affinity with Konkan coast based groups such as these (as opposed to mainstream Deshastha) and hence origins somewhere in the Goa or surrounding area, with migration orchestrated out of Portuguese inquisition rather than Islamic invasion.
